Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is a notoriously difficult problem
 in combinatorial optimization that has garnered considerable attention
 due to both its practical importance and its solution complexity.
 The problem finds numerous applications in manufacturing and is central
 to many supply chain problems that integrate production planning and scheduling.
 For an extensive treatment of planning and scheduling models and applications
 in various supply chain settings, see Pinedo [24].

\begin_layout Standard
The JSSP can be defined by a set of machines specialized to perform ordered
 operations unique for every job.
 No machine can perform more than one operation at a time, each operation
 has a fixed duration (or processing time) and preemption is not allowed.
 Although several performance measures may be used, we consider the classical
 goal of minimizing the duration of the longest job in the schedule, called
 the makespan.
 We use the following notation.
 V = {0, 1, â€¦ , n} denotes the set of operations (with 0 and n the dummy
 start and finish operations); M and J denote the sets of machines and jobs,
 respectively; A denotes the set of pairs of operations constrained by precedenc
e relations (established by the specified sequence of machines for each
 job); and Ek denotes the set of pairs of operations to be performed on
 machine k.
 Finally, we let pv > 0 and tv represent the (fixed) processing time and
 the (variable) start time of operation v, respectively.
 The problem can then be stated as [2]

\begin_layout Standard
The literature on job shop scheduling is immense and contains an abundant
 variety of algorithms.
 Exact solution methods chiefly are represented by branch-and-bound algorithms
 [28], [29] and [3].
 Due to the complexity of the JSSP within the class of NP-complete problems
 [30] these approaches can only solve problems of relatively modest size
 and therefore approximation (or heuristic) methods are required to provide
 solutions for larger instances.
