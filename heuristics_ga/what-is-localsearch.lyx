What is local search?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Local search is a metaheuristic method to optimize solutions for NP-hard
 problems.
 Local search algorithms compare a certain solution with surrounding solutions.
 Each surrounding solution are evaluated and the best one is chosen.
 This repeats itself many times, until the optimized solution is found.
 But how does this algorithm knows if the best solution is found and how
 does it get there?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the algorithm starts, it searches in the search space S for an answer.
 The optimal solutions are a subset of S, called S
\begin_inset Formula $_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 These solutions will be called states, since there is only one optimal
 solution.
 The algorithm decides which state starts as solution candidate.
 Then the neighourhood relation are consulted, to find a better state.
 The neighbourhood relations are defined by it's problem.
 For instance, the only possible relation between states in a CLIQUE-problem
 is to remove or add one node.
 When another state is considered 'better', the algorithm chooses this state
 as it's solution canditate and continues it's loop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the algorithm doesn't have a standard stop condition, it only stops
 if there is no neighbor state which is better.
 It is possible to terminate before this scenario is reached.
 For instance, when time plays a role in the algorithm, or some states (but
 not the optimal state) are good enough.

\begin_layout Standard
The x-axis represents the domain of the problem, all possible states.
 The y-axis represents the value of the state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Imagine the algorithm starts somewhere between the far left and point (a).
 The algorithm will move to the right since the states left of the current
 state are evaluated as worse.
 When the algorithm reaches point (a) it will stop, because both surrounding
 neigbors are worse then the current state.
 In this case, the best solution is found, but what if the algorithm start
 at point (b)? It fails and won't find the best solution.
