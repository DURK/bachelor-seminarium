\begin_layout Subsection
Genetic Hybrid Algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Genetic hybrid algorithms take multiple heuristic algorithms and combine
 them for better performance.
 As explained in Section 2.2, genetic algorithms converge slowly towards
 the optimal solution.
 It is possible to speed up this process by improving each chromosome.
 This allows faster convergence, while maintaining a widely covered search
 space.
 In this section we choose local search as an example of a heuristic that
 can be hybridized with a genetic algorithm.
 This specific example is called genetic local search.
 In the following section, we will first explain the principles of local
 search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Local Search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Local search is a meta-heuristic method to find the optimal solution.
 However, local search doesn't guarantee the optimal solution will be found,
 which will be explained later.
 A meta-heuristic is a combination of multiple heuristics, creating a multi-dime
nsional search space.
 Local search starts with a candidate solution, which is given or picked
 at random.
 The candidate solution is then compared to its neighbourhood, searching
 for a better solution in each dimension of the search space.
 The evaluation of a neighbourhood is done by a fitness function.
 From here there are two options: the 'best improvement' and the 'first
 improvement'.
 The best improvement selects the best solution in its entire neighbourhood,
 while the first improvement selects the first solution that is better than
 the current candidate solution.
 Because the best improvement searches the whole neighbourhood it converges
 slowly, while the first improvement works the other way around.
 This is illustrated in Table 1.

\begin_layout Standard
When local search finds this improved solution it sets this as new candidate
 solution.
 The algorithm will terminate if a better solution in this neighbourhood
 doesn't exist.
 Termination can also take place if a certain amount of iterative steps
 has been taken or if the fitness of the candidate has reached a user specified
 value.

 The blue dotted line is plotted as an example for the fitness function.
 Note that this is a preferable fitness function, since there is only one
 local maximum, thus making it the global maximum.
 Most fitness functions look more similar to 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$

.
 The grey area represents the neighbourhood of the candidate solution.
 The next iterative step will lead to a candidate solution in the direction
 of the local maximum on the right side, since the fitness value of the
 solution to its right is higher than the one to its left side.
 This process continues until the candidate solution reaches this local
 maximum.
 Remember that local search will terminate here and returns the solution
 at this local maximum, which in this example is not the global maximum.
 This situation is avoidable with the use of a genetic algorithm.

Genetic Local Search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A commonly encountered form of genetic hybrid algorithms, for solving combinator
ial optimization problems, is 
\emph on
genetic local search
\emph default
 (GLS).
 Genetic algorithms are designed to be effective at global search, but converge
 slowly.
 Local search on the other hand is effective at fine-tuning but often falls
 into local maxima, as shown in Section 2.2.
 The hybrid approach combines the best of both worlds by combining genetic
 algorithms that perform global search to avoid falling into local maxima
 with local search that handles the fine-tuning

.
 In this section, the general principles of combining genetic algorithms
 with local search are introduced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typical genetic algorithms recombine parents, followed by mutation, in order
 to produce new chromosomes.
 Selection of chromosomes is based on their fitness.
 In standard genetic algorithms, this fitness can be calculated immediately
 after 'birth' by using a fitness function as shown in Section
\emph on
 2.2
\emph default
.
 In GLS, selection is based on fitness after performing local search.
 This means offspring will be improved and these improvements will be passed
 on trough crossover.
 In essence, this causes offspring to 'learn', a principle called 
\emph on
local optimization
\emph default
.
 An example of pseudo-code for GLS is shown in listing
