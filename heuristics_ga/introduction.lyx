\begin_layout Standard
Computer scientists do a lot of research in algorithmic field.
 They try to achieve more optimal, faster and less memory hungry algorithms
 for problems.
 But they also have a lot of problems to solve.
 Most problems that are of interest to the practical computer scientist
 are rather difficult.
 There are diffirent kinds of problems to describe:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Problems in P, there exists an agorithm that solves a problem in polynomal
 time.
 P is in NP.
 These problems are doable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Problems in NP, there doesn't exist a algorithm that solves a problem in
 a polynominal time, but the answer can be verfied in polynominal time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Problems in NPC (np complete).
 NPC is also in NP.
 Because of that, also these problems are veryfiable in polynominal time.
 Also every problem in NP is reducable to NPC.
 NPC is also in NP-hard.
 That means that NPC problems are hardest problems in NP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Problems in NP-hard.
 This is the most difficult set of problems, most found in real life.
 These problems cannot be verified in polynominal time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also a lot of ways to solve a problem.
 For example by using an exact algorithm which can solve a problem in polynomial
 time if a problem is in P.
 Otherwise the exact algorithm will cost exponential time or even more.
 When this is unacceptable, heuristics can be used.
 Heuristics approximate the optimal solution to a problem within acceptable
 amount of time.
 More about it is explained in the next chapter.
 For more difficult problems in NP-hard local search can be used to search
 for solutions.
 Local search returns the local optimum of the space.
 Also Genetic algorithms (GA) can be used, which are like local search also
 a form of heuristic algorithms.
 With GA you work with different answers for a problem, which convert to
 a better answer.
 And finally genetic local search (a combination of genetic algorithms and
 local search will be discussed in the last chapter of this section.
