\section{The Title}

The title of the article is defined in the usual way, with \verb+\title+. For
the authors and their affiliations, three cases are distinguished:

\begin{itemize}
\item One author: define the author with \verb+\author+.
\item Multiple authors: define the authors with
   \verb+\author+, separated by \verb+\and+.
\end{itemize}


\section{The abstract}

Put the abstract before the first section with the \verb+abstract+
environment.


\section{Sections and paragraphs}

  Use the usual \verb+\section+, \verb+\subsection+, and
  \verb+\subsubsection+ command for formatting section heads.

  Do not leave extra space between paragraphs.
  
  Please, do not include a list of contents!  


  \subsection{A Subsection Heading}


  \subsubsection{A Subsubsection Heading}


  \section{Making References}

  Make references in the running text with the \verb+\cite+
  command \cite{dijkstra68}. Multiple referrences go like this
  \cite{charniak85,steels98}.
